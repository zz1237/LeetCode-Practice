#Question:
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

#Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def reverse(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        a = cmp(x,0)*int(str(abs(x))[::-1])
        
        if abs(a)>2147483647:
            return 0
        else:
            return a

*Note: 
1. cmp() is available in Python 2;
2. use abs() to reduce redundancy;
3. understand the overflows (although it's not an issue in Python).
