#Question:
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.



#Solution:
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        characters = []
        
        for char in s:
            if (char == "(") or (char == "[") or (char == "{"):
                characters.append(char)
            if (char == ")"):
                if (characters == []) or (characters.pop() != "("):
                    return False
            if (char == "]"):
                if (characters == []) or (characters.pop() != "["):
                    return False
            if (char == "}"):
                if (characters == []) or (characters.pop() != "{"):
                    return False
     
        if characters==[]:
            return True
        else:
            return False
   
   
#Note:
1. There is at least one pair of parenthesis staying ext to each other;
2. Use of list.pop() to capture the above feature and remove the last letter from the list.


#Another Solution (slower but more concise:
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s):
        if len(s)%2==1:
            return False
        else:
            while ('()' in s) or ('[]' in s) or ('{}' in s):
                s = s.replace('()','').replace('[]','').replace('{}','')
            return (s=='')


#Note:
1. There is at least one pair of parenthesis staying ext to each other;
2. Use of list.replace() to remove the next-to-next parenthesis and create new next-to-next pair.
